# Installing Software and Working Maze Solution Instructions

**Assigned Date**: 29 August 2025
**Due Date**: 1 September 2025, by 9:00am (start of class) via GitHub

## Names of students in your group

**Your Name**: Jake McCallen
**Partners Name**: Katie Walker

### Instructions

Please use clear and meaningful language to respond to each of the following questions. Be specific and concise in your answers.

As you work through the questions, please replace the `TODO` text with your answer. Otherwise the *Gatorgrade* (the automatic assignment checker) will complain that questions have not been answered in your activity.

## Part 1

Q1: List the tools you installed.

Python (Windows ver.)

Q2: Did you encounter any issues during the installation process? If so, how did you resolve them?

No issues encountered.

Q3: For each of the software tools you installed, describe its purpose and provide one feature that you find particularly useful or exciting about it.

Python is used for coding with Python, and I am excited to learn a new coding language.

Q4: How do you plan to use these tools in your future programming projects?

I plan to use Python to code in a new format.

## Part 2

## Reflection: Maze and Instruction-Writing Activity

Please answer the following questions thoughtfully and, again, using clear and meaningful language. These questions are to help you to reflect on the activity that you just completed using mazes and the solution instructions that your wrote. You are now going to connect this activity to programming computers in light of how they follow instructions in source code.

Q5: Which maze (filename) did you choose to solve?

Circle_01

Q5: Which maze (filename) did your partner choose to solve?

Circle_01

Q6: When you followed your partner group's instructions to solve their maze, did you encounter any steps that were unclear or ambiguous? How did you handle these situations, and what does this reveal about the importance of precision in instructions?

I did not encounter any unclear steps.

Q7: If you made a mistake or got stuck while following the instructions, what was the cause? Was it due to an error in the instructions, a misunderstanding, or something else? How does this relate to errors that can occur when a computer runs source code?

I got stuck due to an error in instructions, this can relate to an error where a computer cannot complete an instruction.

Q8: Imagine a computer following your group's instructions exactly as written, without any ability to guess or improvise. Would the computer be able to solve the maze successfully? Why or why not?

I believe the computer would fail, due to the fact that a computer could not guess the length of a unit used in my solution, and would not be able to properly curve around a circle.

Q9: How did you decide what details to include or leave out when writing your own instructions? What challenges did you face in making your instructions both complete and easy to follow?

I left out the details of defining a length of a unit and how to curve around a circle.

Q10: Based on your experience, what are some strategies for writing instructions (or source code) that minimize errors and confusion for the person or computer following them?

To minimize errors, the writer of code should define as many parameters as possible so that the computer or person has no issue going over the instructions.

Q11: Please place your maze solution "code" below.

Define L: Direction most towards the left side of the screen.
Define R: Direction most towards the right side of the screen.
Define D: Direction most towards the bottom of the screen.
Define U: Direction most towards the top of the screen.
Layer F: Direction most towards the edge of the screen.
Layer B: Direction most towards the closest outside border of the maze.
Define step (X): Proceed X times
