# Installing Software and Working Maze Solution Instructions

**Assigned Date**: 29 August 2025
**Due Date**: 1 September 2025, by 9:00am (start of class) via GitHub

## Names of students in your group

**Your Name**: Jake McCallen
**Partners Name**: Katie Walker

### Instructions

Please use clear and meaningful language to respond to each of the following questions. Be specific and concise in your answers.

As you work through the questions, please replace the `TODO` text with your answer. Otherwise the *Gatorgrade* (the automatic assignment checker) will complain that questions have not been answered in your activity.

## Part 1

Q1: List the tools you installed.

Python (All other tools already installed)

Q2: Did you encounter any issues during the installation process? If so, how did you resolve them?

I did not encounter any issues.

Q3: For each of the software tools you installed, describe its purpose and provide one feature that you find particularly useful or exciting about it.

I am excited about learning how to code with python.

Q4: How do you plan to use these tools in your future programming projects?

I will be using these tools to learn more styles of coding and more efficient coding.

## Part 2

## Reflection: Maze and Instruction-Writing Activity

Please answer the following questions thoughtfully and, again, using clear and meaningful language. These questions are to help you to reflect on the activity that you just completed using mazes and the solution instructions that your wrote. You are now going to connect this activity to programming computers in light of how they follow instructions in source code.

Q5: Which maze (filename) did you choose to solve?

circle_01

Q5: Which maze (filename) did your partner choose to solve?

I did not receive proper code as of 9/1/2025 at 9:54 AM.

Q6: When you followed your partner group's instructions to solve their maze, did you encounter any steps that were unclear or ambiguous? How did you handle these situations, and what does this reveal about the importance of precision in instructions?

I did not receive proper code as of 9/1/2025 at 9:54 AM.

Q7: If you made a mistake or got stuck while following the instructions, what was the cause? Was it due to an error in the instructions, a misunderstanding, or something else? How does this relate to errors that can occur when a computer runs source code?

I did not receive proper code as of 9/1/2025 at 9:54 AM.

Q8: Imagine a computer following your group's instructions exactly as written, without any ability to guess or improvise. Would the computer be able to solve the maze successfully? Why or why not?

I believe a computer would struggle due to the undefined "step" distance, but this could be easily rectified.

Q9: How did you decide what details to include or leave out when writing your own instructions? What challenges did you face in making your instructions both complete and easy to follow?

I considered what could be a variable when coding, and faced the challenges of needing to question what unit of distance to use.

Q10: Based on your experience, what are some strategies for writing instructions (or source code) that minimize errors and confusion for the person or computer following them?

Defining everything that could be a variable before writing 'acting' code.

Q11: Please place your maze solution "code" below.
